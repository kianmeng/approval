## v0.2.1

Improved documentation.
No new features.

## v0.2.0

Approval now generates a `.diff.html` file based on the file name of the snapshot
instead of the file name of the reference. This was changed because the same
image can serve as reference for a number of outputs but the snapshot will usually
be unique.

## v0.1.0

First public release
